# Some context on the Raspberry Pi

A Raspberry Pi is a miniature computer designed to be as compact and energy efficient as possible while also
being extremely compact (The size of a credit card for the bigger models).

These characteristics make them very well suited to be the basis for an IOT device, they are versatile 
but still incredibly cheap at a mere $15 for the lower models. The Pi's architecture allows it to take
advantage of Web technology to communicate information to the user, it is very easy to host any form 
of small cloud service on a Raspberry Pi making it much cheaper to build up a home infrastructure than it used to with more established technologies 

# 1. Smart Agriculture Using Internet Of Things With Raspberry Pi

## Context

## Needs

* Increase the efficiency of currently used technology
* Decrease loss caused by unforeseen soil based issues

## Why use IOT technology ?

* Small nodes which can be easily deployed and linked together to form a vast, farm wide system to monitor every information that can be used to help grow crops or tend to animals more efficiently and more easily
* Infinitely expendable by adding more nodes -> potentially long term investment strategy
* Still centrally controlled -> easy to manage or to integrate into data-driven models to help make the processes more efficient

## Examples

### Large scale :

Fully autonomous tractors/harvesters to take the physical effort out of the hands of the farmer and to allow the architecture to be used 24/7 and to minimize loss encored during the harvesting process by having a precise path.

Autonomous kettle feeding mechanism to give the animals the exact quantity they need at specific times once again without direct intervention outside of a farm-wide monitoring station

### Small scale :

Single node systems for small vegetable growing gardens to make sure humidity and PH levels stay within a margin of error for the growth of the crops

This would potentially allow people to grow more food in their gardens thus lessening the need for huge corporations to grow and transport the food. 
This solution would also reduce CO2 production by a large margin if a considerable portion of people start growing their own food.

This option takes the need for time in the garden out of the equation, allowing gardening to take a place in the busy lives we live nowadays.

## Socio-Economic impact of such an implementation

### Large scale :
This solution put even more emphasis that there already is on capital investment for farming which would push food production even more in the hands of massive corporations and potentially even allowing the creation of a monopoly on food which would be disastrous for our society. We have seen what corporations like Amazon are capable of when it comes to shaping markets in their favor, one can only think of what would unfold were they to take control of the food supply.

### Small scale :
On the contrary, allowing people to take back some of their freedom in the food they consume would have the opposite effect, reducing the need for global supply chains to get food from some piece of dirt on one side of the world to a plate in another, most often with lesser quality food, where a well preserved garden could yield great quality food for a fraction of the cost and most importantly a fraction of the CO2 released in the atmosphere.
